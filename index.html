    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      <br /><br />
      To ensure that users/clients or server of you website donâ€™t get hacked and
      try to prevent any unauthorized access by some who may want to steal
      sensitive information between your website and users/clients,<br />
      or try to prevent any unauthorized to steal,delete or change any data
      stored in your server filesystem and database<br />
      <br /><br />
      <b>I would highly recommended you to:</b><br />
      <br />
      - Hire an external organization who can scan,test and eventually maintane
      the website/server security for eventually vulnerability issues,<br />
      &nbsp&nbspand/or you could offer substantial bounties to find
      vulnerabilities.
      <br /><br />

      - Encourage strong passwords and consider two-factor authentication for
      the website.<br /><br />

      - Make sure that the data sent between the website server and your
      database server is secured and encrypted to ensure that user information
      are not easily stolen.<br />
      &nbsp&nbspTo do that we recommend you that we implement a server side
      cybersecurity web framework.<br /><br />

      - Let us check and eventually configure your web server to ensure its
      secure and use secure connection(HTTPS,HSTS) between your website and
      clients/users,<br />
      &nbsp&nbspthis is necessary to protect your clients/users sent or recieved
      data from getting hacked and stolen.<br />
