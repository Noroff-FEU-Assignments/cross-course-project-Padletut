      <br /><br />
      <b>We would highly recommended you to consider:</b><br />
      <br />
      -What network is the web site server supposed to be running at?<br /><br />
      -We suggest that you run your website on a seperate network or rent a web
      hosting<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;service if you got important data to protect against
      hackers.<br /><br />

      - That we are setting up a plan so we can maintaince and update your web
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;site continous, for security safety.<br /><br />

      - You could hire an external organization who can scan and test the
      website/server security for eventually vulnerability issues,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;and/or you could offer substantial bounties to find
      vulnerabilities.
      <br /><br />

      - Encourage strong passwords and consider two-factor authentication for
      the website. <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;We recommend you to let us implement OneLogin,Okta, etc. for
      your website login <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;to ensure that authorization is hard to hack.<br /><br />

      - We recommend you to have automatic usertimeout, to protect users who
      don't log out after use.<br /><br />

      - We recommend you to let us implement a server side cybersecurity web
      framework. To ensure security of data sent between website and database<br /><br />

      - We recommend you to let us or your security team to check and
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;configure your web server to ensure it is secure and use
      secure connection(HTTPS,HSTS) between your website and clients/users,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;this is necessary to protect your clients/users sent or
      recieved data from getting hacked and stolen.<br />
